# Flame-by-web-Development
This project successfully demonstrates how pure HTML and CSS can be used creatively to simulate a realistic flame animation without any JavaScript or external libraries. By carefully layering colored divs, applying CSS transformations, and designing a smooth keyframe animation, we were able to mimic the natural flickering motion and color gradients found in real fire.

This not only shows the power of CSS for visual effects, but also emphasizes the importance of creative design thinking in front-end development. The final output is lightweight, browser-compatible, and visually impressive â€” all achieved with fundamental web technologies.
